## Solution

1. Why did you use that data structure?
    
    Linked List closely resembles a block chain ideologically. Hence why I chose to use it, also per suggestion of the problem description.

2. You also need to explain the efficiency (time and space) of your solution.

    The solution is implemented using LIFO type Linked List. Insertion operations are `O(1)` constant time and traversals are `O(n)` time. Space complexity is about `O(n)` proportional to the amount of data beign appended.
